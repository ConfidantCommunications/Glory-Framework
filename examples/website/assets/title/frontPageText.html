	Welcome to <b>Glory Framework</b>. As you can see, you can create <i>text objects</i> quite easily. Simply create an &lt;actor&gt; in the config.xml file. It supports all the attributes of the OpenFL TextField, plus a separate attribute for TextFormat. If you use rigidFillPercentWidth and maintainAspectRatio for the layout, you are guaranteed to have a minimum text size.
