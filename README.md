##Introduction
Glory Framework is a page-based media framework built using [Haxe](http://haxe.org/), [OpenFL](http://openfl.org), and [PureMVC](http://puremvc.org/). It can be used for interactive e-books, adventure games, websites, or slide presentations on any target supported by OpenFL.

##Easy configuration
It uses an XML configuration file to build the layout of each page, including placement and function of different controls. Each page can have its own custom class if desired.

Glory can operate in “app mode”, where all assets are embedded. When app mode is disabled, it will operate like a website and load assets only when required.

##Easy workflow from design to end product
* Photoshop: Glory also includes two scripts which make it easy to rapidly convert a PSD layout into something that Glory can use. 
* Vector: It can also use SVG files saved directly from Illustrator, Inkscape or other software.
* Adobe Animate (a.k.a. Flash): Prepare your assets as SWF files and optionally convert them to .bundle files.
