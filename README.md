Glory Framework is a page-based media framework built using [Haxe](http://haxe.org/), [OpenFL](http://openfl.org), and [PureMVC](http://puremvc.org/). It can be used for interactive e-books, adventure games, websites, or slide presentations on any target supported by OpenFL.

It uses an XML configuration file to build the layout of each page, including placement and function of different controls. Each page can have its own custom class if desired.

Glory can operate in “app mode”, where all assets are embedded. When app mode is disabled, it will operate like a website and load assets only when required.

Glory also includes two Photoshop scripts which make it easy to rapidly convert a PSD layout into something that Glory can use. It can also use SVG files saved directly from Illustrator (not all types of object are supported).

Be sure to read the [wiki pages](https://github.com/ConfidantCommunications/Glory-Framework/wiki) to learn how to get set up.
Here is [a compiled HTML5 demo](http://confidant.ca/demo/glory/).
