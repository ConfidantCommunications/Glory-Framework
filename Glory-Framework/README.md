Glory Framework is a page-based media framework built using Haxe, NME, and PureMVC. 

It can be used for interactive e-books, adventure games, slide presentations on any target supported by NME.

It uses an XML configuration file to build the layout of each screen, including placement and function of different controls.

Glory also includes two Photoshop scripts which make it easy to rapidly convert a PSD layout into something that Glory can use. It can also use SVG files saved directly from Illustrator (not all types of object are supported).

This framework requires the SVG and Actuate libraries available on haxelib. Please note that using SVG with the HTML5 target will not work unless you are using a version of NME >later< than the 3.4.2. release.
