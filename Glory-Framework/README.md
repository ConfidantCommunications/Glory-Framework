Glory Framework is a page-based media framework built using Haxe, NME, and PureMVC. 

It can be used for interactive e-books, adventure games, slide presentations on any target supported by NME.

It uses an XML configuration file to build the layout of each screen, including placement and function of different controls.

Glory also includes two Photoshop scripts which make it easy to rapidly convert a PSD layout into something that Glory can use.
